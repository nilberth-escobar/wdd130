    <h3>Nilberth Escobar</h3>
    <p>Hello everbody <br>
        My name is Nilberth Escobar. When people doesn't know how to say my name they just call me "you", haha. Then I tell them my second name which is Rafael. <br><br>

        I took a programming class 15 years ago, when I didn't even know what I was doing, haha, but I has helped me with the basic idea of programming. <br><br>

        I've been working as an english teacher the last 5 years. Despite I am an english teacher, I know I have a long way in learning the language such when to use "other" and "another", idioms and slangs... long way to go. I am planning in creating a videogame someday, I hope live long enough to do it. <br><br>

        I like going on trips but I don't like to do the packing ritual, that is my big "nah, I stay home" ðŸ¤£<br><br>

        Hope we can help each other, but most of the time you will be helping me :) :) <br><br>
